This folder contains files representing the Abstract Data Types available for use in the front end.

All data received from the data base should be converted from raw JSON into one of these models
before being used in order to maintain adequate abstraction.

Models can also include logic to process and interpret the data they contain (for example, there may
be a function in a Workout which calculates the number of calories that workout should burn)
